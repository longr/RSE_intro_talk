# Software sustainability:

why it's vital to research


## Why is software important?

* Research is a process
* Software is an important step in that process

<!-- 
if you cannot do research without a computer, you cannot do it without software
like lab equipment it needs to be "callibrated" and "checked"
-->

## What is Research software?

* Research software is any software that is used to generate, process
  or analyse results that you intend to use in a publication.
* It can be anything from a few lines of code written by yourself, to
  a professionally developed software package.


# How important is software?


## How many use software?

# What is software engineering?


##

* Making better software for people


# What are Research Software Engineers?


##

* A Research Software Engineer (RSE) combines professional software
  engineering expertise with an intimate understanding of research.

* "RSEs collaborate with researchers to develop the software they need" - Simon Hettrick

## 

* Reproducible (add definition)
* Replicable (add definition)

<!--
* Reproducible + replicable
  * Does it work on Can it be ran on a different machine? (Portable)
  * Do I need your postdoc to run it? (Documentation) %Tweet - download postdoc
  * Can I access it? (Store in repository and license)
  * Is software correct?
	* Did it get tested? Does it have tests?

# Software skill are vital


##

<!--# SH - https://slides.com/simonhettrick/software-skills-are-vital-to-research#/6-->

* Software is fundamental to all disciplines of research[^1]
* Software skills will allow you to work faster, more reliably and with less boredom
* We provide access to training and support to help you in your research

## Slide 1 title

Some super quickly created demo slides

* Do not need anything else than markdown
    * Slides title starts with ## (also starts a new slide)
    * Bullet points, newlines, empty lines: all standard markdown
* However, can also use other stuff, e.g.:
    * Some HTML (e.g. \<center\>)
    * When using pandoc beamer, can use latex commands (e.g. \\center, \\large, etc)\dots

## Slide 2 title

\center The slide syntax is so simple that you can quickly create a handful of slides on basically any device in any editor. E.g. on your mobile on the way to the meeting where you need the slides. Right before the meeting starts you use pandoc to create the actual slides from your source.
